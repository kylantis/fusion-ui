    Note: "menu" is never rendered on the DOM, hence data-binding is not available
    for it. If you need to update an item on this menu at a later time, you need to
    replace the entire menu, i.e. 
    this.getInput().menu = ... (on the client-side) or
    contextMenu.setMenu(...) (on the server-side)
