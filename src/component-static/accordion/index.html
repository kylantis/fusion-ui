                    shops, private owners, or shelters. A pet shop may be the most convenient way to buy a dog. Buying a
                    dog from a private owner allows you to assess the pedigree and upbringing of your dog before
                    choosing to take it home. Lastly, finding your dog from a shelter, helps give a good home to a dog
                    who may not find one so readily.
